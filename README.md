# EmotionJS Next App

Test implementation of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/styled) styled components in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)

With a lot of help from this [example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-emotion)

## What for?

- Researching the best techniques, packages, etc. for creating and styling standalone UI components in NextJS apps

- Using storybook to demo, view and test components

- Create a standard for creating components with template and/or script

## Component Structure

Sample:

```
src/components/Modal
├── Modal.jsx
├── Modal.stories.jsx
├── Modal.styles.jsx
└── index.js
```
